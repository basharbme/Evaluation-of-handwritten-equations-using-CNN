Evaluation of Handwritten Expression using CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks)

The CNN is trained with the images in the datasetwhich has the 13 classes (0-9,+,-,*)(cnn.py)

The input image given from the user is segmented and using our trained CNN we predict the class of the images 
which is stored in the form of string and we perform string operations to get the result.(segment.py)
